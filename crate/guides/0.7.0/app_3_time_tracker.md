## Intro

Let's write something more interesting!

You'll learn:
- Fire & handle [Fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) requests.
- About [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/).
- To write modules/components.
- Advanced routing, link building and how to change a base path.
- To work with global state / context.
- To architect a large app.
- How to integrate [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).

## Motivation

We should always identify what are the problems we want to resolve before we even start to think about our app.
