# Getting Started

Hi and welcome! 

Many awesome contributors and I ([Martin Kav√≠k](https://github.com/MartinKavik)) will be your guides in the Seed world. You'll learn something about Rust and then we'll discover the beauty of Seed apps.

- I think the best way how to learn something is by doing it. That's why we'll be writing basic Seed apps together and we'll show you how to use multiple Seed APIs and patterns.

- Also we'll explain you some design decisions and you'll find our personal opinions, notes and future plans in the most chapters. Please, keep in mind that they are often very opinionated and based on our previous experiences, so it's possible that you won't agree.
The most of them are mine, so don't hesitate to write me about your opinions or when you have some questions ([chat](https://discord.gg/JHHcHp5), [forum](https://seed.discourse.group/), [martin@kavik.cz](mailto:martin@kavik.cz)).

- We assume you know basics of [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML), [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps).

Let's look at [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in the next chapter. Click on the right arrow below this text.
